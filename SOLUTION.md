# WebAuthn FIDO2 HTTPS Certificate Issue - SOLVED

## Problem Summary

The user encountered a security error when trying to register WebAuthn credentials after setting up HTTPS with self-signed certificates. The browser warned about an untrusted connection, and even after clicking "continue anyway," WebAuthn registration failed with a security error.

## Root Cause

WebAuthn requires a **secure context** to function properly. While browsers treat `http://localhost` as a secure context for basic WebAuthn functionality, self-signed certificates that are not trusted by the browser do **not** create a proper secure context. This causes WebAuthn to throw security errors when attempting to use advanced features.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Proper Self-Signed Certificate Generation
- Created `generate_cert.sh` script that generates certificates with proper Subject Alternative Name (SAN) extensions
- Includes localhost, 127.0.0.1, and IPv6 localhost in the certificate
- Uses proper key usage and extended key usage extensions

### 2. Server Improvements
- Enhanced server startup to detect missing certificates and provide helpful guidance
- Added `--http` command-line option for fallback HTTP mode
- Clear error messages and setup instructions

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation
- `HTTPS_SETUP.md` with multiple solution approaches
- Updated `README.adoc` with HTTPS setup instructions
- Browser-specific certificate import instructions

## How to Use the Solution

1. **Generate certificates:**
   ```bash
   cd examples/server
   ./generate_cert.sh
   ```

2. **Import certificate into browser** (choose your browser):
   
   **Chrome/Edge:**
   - Go to `chrome://settings/certificates`
   - Click 'Authorities' tab → 'Import' → select `cert.pem`
   - Check 'Trust this certificate for identifying websites'
   
   **Firefox:**
   - Go to `about:preferences#privacy`
   - Certificates section → 'View Certificates' → 'Authorities' tab
   - 'Import' → select `cert.pem`
   - Check 'Trust this CA to identify websites'

3. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   python server/server.py
   ```

4. **Visit:** `https://localhost:5000`

## Alternative Solutions

### Option 1: Browser Certificate Bypass (Development Only)
```bash
# Chrome/Edge - DEVELOPMENT ONLY
google-chrome --ignore-certificate-errors --ignore-ssl-errors --allow-running-insecure-content
```

### Option 2: Use mkcert Tool
```bash
# Install mkcert, then:
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
mv localhost+2.pem cert.pem
mv localhost+2-key.pem key.pem
```

### Option 3: HTTP Fallback
```bash
python server/server.py --http
# Visit: http://localhost:5000 (limited WebAuthn features)
```

## Key Points

1. **Self-signed certificates must be explicitly trusted** by the browser to create a secure context for WebAuthn
2. **Certificate warnings ≠ secure context** - even if you click "continue anyway," WebAuthn may still fail
3. **Advanced WebAuthn features** (attestation, largeBlob, etc.) require a true secure context
4. **Development tools are available** to bypass certificate validation for testing

## Files Created/Modified

- `examples/server/generate_cert.sh` - Certificate generation script
- `examples/server/HTTPS_SETUP.md` - Comprehensive setup documentation
- `examples/server/server/server.py` - Enhanced server with better error handling
- `examples/server/README.adoc` - Updated with HTTPS instructions
- `examples/server/localhost.conf` - OpenSSL configuration for proper certificates

The solution is now complete and tested. Users can generate proper certificates and import them into their browsers for full WebAuthn functionality with HTTPS.
