# WebAuthn FIDO2 Test Application (With PQC Support)

A test server and web UI for WebAuthn/FIDO2 registration and authentication. It displays the selected algorithm, authenticator flags (UP/UV/AT/ED/BE/BS), sign counter, and extension results (credProps, PRF, largeBlob) for validation.

Built on python-fido2-PQC, which is built on Yubico‚Äôs python-fido2. Classical algorithms work by default;

# üíª Local setup

This guide shows how to clone the repository and set up a working local environment for WebAuthn with Python FIDO2 on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Scope
- Includes: Python, virtual environment, Flask, python-fido2, Post‚ÄëQuantum Crypto algorithm options (PQC).
---

## Supported platforms

- Windows 10/11 (64‚Äëbit)
- macOS (Intel or Apple Silicon)
- Linux (Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora/Arch, etc.)

A modern browser (eg. Edge, Chrome, Safari, Firefox) with WebAuthn support is required. 

---

## 1) Prerequisites

- Git: install from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)
- Python 3.12+ (64‚Äëbit) with pip
  - Windows: Install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and check ‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH.‚Äù
  - macOS: Install via [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/) or Homebrew.
  - Linux: Install via your distro or [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/source/).

---

## 2) Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rainzhang05/python-fido2-webauthn-test.git
cd python-fido2-webauthn-test
```

---

## 3) Recommended setup ‚Äî pip + venv

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
# Create and activate a virtual environment using Python 3.12
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\scripts\activate

# Upgrade pip and install runtime dependencies
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install fido2 flask cryptography cbor2

# Optional: if you need PC/SC smart card extras (pyscard)
pip install "fido2[pcsc]"
```

### macOS and Linux (bash/zsh)

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip and install runtime dependencies
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install fido2 flask cryptography cbor2

# Optional: if you need PC/SC smart card extras (pyscard)
pip install "fido2[pcsc]"
```

```

---

## 4) Optional setup ‚Äî Poetry (instead of pip/venv)

Use Poetry if you prefer its workflow. It will create `.venv` inside the project.

### Install Poetry

- Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
# Install pipx for isolated CLI apps (user-level)
py -3.12 -m pip install --user pipx
py -3.12 -m pipx ensurepath
# Open a NEW PowerShell window so PATH changes apply

# Install Poetry via pipx
pipx install poetry


```

- macOS/Linux (bash/zsh):

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
python3 -m pipx ensurepath
# Open a new terminal
pipx install poetry
poetry --version
```

### Use Poetry in this project

```bash
# From the repo root
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true

# Point Poetry to your Python (choose one):
poetry env use 3.12
# OR give an absolute path if needed:
# poetry env use "/usr/bin/python3"                # macOS/Linux example
# poetry env use "C:\Path\To\Python312\python.exe" # Windows example

poetry install

```

## 5) Install and use pytest

Pytest is used to run unit tests. If your local clone includes a `tests/` folder (or you add your own tests), these commands will discover and run them.

- pip + venv
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install pytest
pytest
```

- Poetry (installs as a dev dependency)
```bash
poetry add --group dev pytest
poetry run pytest
```

---

## PQC Setup

### 1. Activate Your Python Virtual Environment

If not already activated:
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate
```

---

### 2. Install PQC Cryptography Libraries

To enable the ML-DSA (post-quantum) algorithms end-to-end you only need to
install the optional ``pqc`` dependency set. The extra pulls in the Open Quantum
Safe Python bindings (``oqs``) that the FIDO2 server uses to verify ML-DSA
signatures as well as the auxiliary ``pqcrypto`` wheel.

*Pip / virtualenv*

```bash
pip install ".[pqc]"
python -c "import oqs"
```

*Poetry*

```bash
poetry install --with pqc
poetry run python -c "import oqs"
```

Once installed, the browser UI exposes dedicated ``ML-DSA-44`` and ``ML-DSA-65``
checkboxes that seed ``pubKeyCredParams`` in the JSON editor. The advanced
registration workflow forwards those algorithms untouched to the Flask backend,
which in turn advertises them to temporary ``Fido2Server`` instances and uses
``python-fido2``‚Äôs ML-DSA verification paths (powered by ``oqs``) when the
authenticator selects them.

## mkcert Setup for Local HTTPS (Windows & macOS)

This guide explains how to install **mkcert** and generate SSL/TLS certificates for local development in a Python project.  
The certificates created by mkcert are trusted by your system, so you can run your project locally over HTTPS without browser warnings.

---

### 1. Install mkcert

#### Windows
1. Download the latest `mkcert.exe` from the official releases page:  
   üëâ https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/releases  

2. Place `mkcert.exe` in a folder included in your **PATH** (for example: `C:\Windows\System32`).

3. Open **PowerShell** and run:
   ```powershell
   mkcert -install


#### macOS
```
# Install mkcert with Homebrew
brew install mkcert

# Install nss if you use Firefox
brew install nss

# Create and trust the local Certificate Authority (CA)
mkcert -install
```
This creates and trusts a local CA on your Mac.


### 2. Generate Certificates
Windows
In PowerShell, move to your Python project directory:
```
cd C:\path\to\your\project

# Generate certificate and private key for localhost
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

macOS
In Terminal, move to your Python project directory:
```
cd /path/to/your/project

# Generate certificate and private key for localhost
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```
Note: Adding 127.0.0.1 is just for backup, WebAuthn cannot work on 127.0.0.1, but can work on localhost. 
      The name for certificate also vary depending on the system you are using. You can change the name for the .pem files in examples/server/server/server.py (line 1061) if the program is failing to find the .pem files. 

# üöÄ Quickstart: create a virtual environment, run the demo server, and use the test app

Note: Your server entry point is a Python file. Use:
- python examples/server/server/server.py

---

## 1) Create and activate a virtual environment

Run these from the repository's root directory.

### Windows PowerShell
```powershell
# Create venv in the project root (only the first time is required)
py -3 -m venv .venv

# Activate it (required everytime you use the authenticator)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### macOS / Linux
```bash
# Create venv in the project root (only the first time is required)
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate it (required everytime you use the authenticator)
source .venv/bin/activate
```

---

## 2) Install dependencies

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install flask fido2
```

---

## 3) Run the demo server

From the repository root:
```bash
python examples/server/server/server.py
```

You should see Flask start and a line similar to:
```
Running on http://localhost:5000/
```

By clicking on the localhost link, the test app will be launched in a browser tab. 


#### Note: Credentials are saved in your local repository's examples/server/server as pkl files, deleting credentials in the test app will also delete the corresponding pkl file in your local path.
