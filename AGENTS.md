# AGENTS.md

This file is a quick orientation guide for coding agents working in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This project is a Flask-based WebAuthn/FIDO2 demo and developer tool focused on:

- Simple registration and authentication flows
- Advanced WebAuthn request editing and debugging
- Post-quantum credential and algorithm experiments
- Credential inspection, attestation decoding, and metadata exploration
- A browser-based decoder for WebAuthn / CTAP structures

The repo includes both the application and a local `fido2/` library copy used by the server.

## High-Level Layout

- `server/app/`
  Flask app, route handlers, configuration, storage, attestation processing, metadata bootstrap, decoder logic.
- `frontend/templates/`
  Jinja/HTML templates for the main tabs and shared UI fragments.
- `frontend/static/scripts/`
  Frontend behavior, organized by feature area.
- `frontend/static/styles/`
  Shared and advanced-tab CSS.
- `tests/`
  App, library, PQC, and optional device tests.
- `fido2/`
  Local Python FIDO2 implementation used by the app. Treat changes here as library-level changes, not normal UI work.

## Frontend Map

The app is a multi-tab UI wired together from `frontend/static/scripts/main.js`.

Important frontend entry points:

- `frontend/static/scripts/simple/auth-simple.js`
  Simple register/authenticate flows.
- `frontend/static/scripts/advanced/auth/advanced.js`
  Advanced register/authenticate flows.
- `frontend/static/scripts/advanced/credentials/index.js`
  Shared saved-credential list, card rendering, credential detail modal, list refresh behavior.
- `frontend/static/scripts/advanced/editor/index.js`
  Advanced JSON editor state and synchronization.
- `frontend/static/scripts/shared/ui/navigation.js`
  Top-level tab switching and advanced sub-tab switching.
- `frontend/static/scripts/shared/storage/local.js`
  Browser-side stored credential records and serialization sent back to the server.
- `frontend/static/styles/shared/layout.css`
  Shared layout and credential card animation styles.

Important templates:

- `frontend/templates/simple/tab.html`
- `frontend/templates/advanced/tab.html`
- `frontend/templates/decoder/tab.html`
- `frontend/templates/shared/navigation.html`

## Backend Map

Flask app setup starts in:

- `server/app/app.py`
- `server/app/config.py`

Main route modules:

- `server/app/routes/simple.py`
  Simple WebAuthn begin/complete endpoints.
- `server/app/routes/advanced.py`
  Advanced WebAuthn begin/complete endpoints, algorithm handling, request validation, metadata-heavy flows.
- `server/app/routes/general.py`
  Index page, metadata bootstrap helpers, decoder endpoints, misc app routes.

Related backend modules:

- `server/app/attestation.py`
  Attestation parsing and validation helpers.
- `server/app/storage.py`
  Persistent credential storage helpers.
- `server/app/metadata.py`
  Metadata cache/bootstrap logic.
- `server/app/decoder/`
  Decoder/encoder logic used by the developer tooling UI.

## How Data Flows

For authentication work, the important path is usually:

1. Frontend collects stored credentials from browser-side storage.
2. Begin endpoint issues request options and stores server-side state in Flask session.
3. Browser performs `navigator.credentials.create/get`.
4. Complete endpoint verifies the response using `create_fido_server(...)`.
5. Frontend updates local saved credential state and refreshes the shared credential list.

The saved credential cards shown in simple and advanced tabs are rendered by the same shared display module, so UI changes there often affect both tabs.

## Common Places To Edit

- Credential card visuals or behavior:
  `frontend/static/scripts/advanced/credentials/index.js`
  `frontend/static/styles/shared/layout.css`
- Simple auth UX:
  `frontend/static/scripts/simple/auth-simple.js`
  `server/app/routes/simple.py`
- Advanced auth UX:
  `frontend/static/scripts/advanced/auth/advanced.js`
  `server/app/routes/advanced.py`
- JSON editor or advanced request shaping:
  `frontend/static/scripts/advanced/editor/index.js`
  `frontend/static/scripts/advanced/auth/forms.js`
  `frontend/static/scripts/advanced/auth/hints.js`

## Testing Guidance

Fast checks:

- Frontend syntax:
  `node --check <file>`
- Python syntax:
  `python -m compileall <file-or-dir>`
- Focused pytest:
  `pytest -q tests/app/<target_test>.py`

Repo test layout:

- `tests/app/`
  Flask/app behavior.
- `tests/fido2/`
  Library-level tests for the local `fido2/` copy.
- `tests/pqc/`
  PQC-related tests.
- `tests/device/`
  Hardware tests. These are skipped unless explicitly enabled.

If you are changing only UI logic plus lightweight server responses, prefer targeted tests over the full suite first.

## Linting

- Ruff config lives in the root `ruff.toml`, not in `pyproject.toml` (that file is
  the vendored `fido2/` library's manifest).
- Run it with `uvx ruff@0.16.8 check .` Ruff is deliberately kept out of
  `uv.lock` and the venv, so do not `uv add` it.
- CI fails on any violation of the gated set (`E4`, `E7`, `E9`, `F`, `I`,
  `UP006/UP007/UP035/UP045`). It is at zero; keep it there.
- `F821` is off on purpose and `F401`/`UP035` are ignored in the five
  split-module namespace carriers. `ruff.toml` explains why; read it before
  changing either.
- Do not run `ruff format` -- the repo is not format-clean and it would rewrite
  about 69% of the files.

## Python Dependencies

- App dependencies are declared only in `server/pyproject.toml`; resolved versions are locked in `uv.lock`.
  The Docker image, CI and local venvs all install from that lock.
- Set up or refresh a local venv: `uv sync --locked`
- Add or change a dependency: edit `server/pyproject.toml`, run `uv lock`, commit both files.
  A stale lock fails the Docker build and CI.
- The root `pyproject.toml` is the vendored `fido2/` library's manifest, not the app's.

## CI, Deploys And Bots

- Two independent pipelines run on a push to `main`: GitHub Actions
  (`.github/workflows/ci-*.yml`) and Cloud Build (`cloudbuild.yaml`). A red CI
  run does not stop Cloud Build, so `cloudbuild.yaml` runs pytest and vitest
  itself before it builds an image. Keep that gate: it is the only thing
  between a commit and production.
- `ci-*.yml` run on `pull_request` and on `push` to `main` only. Do not drop the
  branch filter; without it a same-repo PR runs everything twice.
- Every action is pinned to a commit SHA with the version in a trailing comment.
  Dependabot bumps both. Do not reintroduce a floating tag -- and note that
  `astral-sh/setup-uv` publishes no floating major tag at all.
- No workflow pushes to `main`. `update-footer-year.yml` commits to a bot branch
  through `.github/actions/open-bot-pr` and opens a pull request, staging an
  explicit path list rather than `git add -A`. GitHub does not start workflow
  runs for events signed by `GITHUB_TOKEN`, so set a `BOT_PR_TOKEN` secret if
  those pull requests should get CI automatically. Enforcement still depends on
  branch protection on `main`, which lives in repository settings, not here.
- Coverage is a gate, not a published number: the floors in `.coveragerc` and
  `vitest.config.mjs` fail CI, and there is no coverage badge or badge workflow.
  Do not add one back.
- `fido2/hid/macos.py` is omitted from coverage on purpose: its only test module
  skips itself off Darwin, so measuring it made the total depend on the runner's
  OS and the floor could not hold on both.
- Frontend installs use `npm ci` everywhere. `package-lock.json` must list all
  fifteen `@rolldown/binding-*` platform packages -- vitest pulls rolldown and
  the Linux runner needs its own. If a lock regeneration drops them, delete
  `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` and run `npm install` from clean; npm
  prunes foreign-platform optional dependencies when it reconciles against a
  partial tree (npm/cli#4828).
- `ci-security.yml` fails the build on a `pip-audit` finding against `uv.lock`,
  on `npm audit --audit-level=high`, and on a fixable HIGH/CRITICAL Trivy
  finding in the image. Each threshold is justified in a comment next to it. If
  a scan starts failing, fix the dependency -- do not widen the threshold.
- The runtime stage of the `Dockerfile` runs `apt-get upgrade`. Removing it puts
  thirteen fixable HIGH/CRITICAL Debian CVEs back into the image.

## The FIDO MDS Snapshot

- The ~30MB generated snapshot under `frontend/static/` is **not tracked in git**
  and **not baked into the image**. `server/app/mds_provisioning.py` fetches it at
  runtime: local files, then Cloud Storage, then a verified upstream refresh.
- Working locally: run `python tools/update_mds_snapshot.py` once. Without it the
  metadata APIs return 404 and the explorer is empty; that is the documented
  fallback, not a bug.
- Never commit those files and never write a test that reads the real snapshot
  path. `docs/MDS_SNAPSHOT.md` has the full picture.

## Repo-Specific Gotchas

- The frontend is plain JS modules, not React/Vue.
- Global functions are intentionally exposed from `frontend/static/scripts/main.js` for template event handlers.
- The simple and advanced tabs share the saved credential display, so re-render logic can have cross-tab side effects.
- Flask session state matters in begin/complete flows. Be careful not to break the fallback `__session_state` handling.
- `server/app/routes/advanced.py` is large. Search before editing and make the smallest safe change.
- The local `fido2/` directory is part of the repo. Do not assume behavior matches the latest upstream package.

## Good First Step For Most Tasks

Before changing code, identify:

1. Which tab or route owns the user-visible behavior.
2. Whether the change affects shared credential rendering.
3. Whether the server returns data that the frontend currently needs but does not receive.
4. The smallest focused test that proves the change.

## Recommended Working Style

- Read the specific route and its matching frontend module together.
- Prefer focused fixes over broad refactors unless the task explicitly asks for restructuring.
- Verify both simple and advanced flows whenever you touch shared credential UI or browser storage behavior.
- When adding server response fields, update both the frontend handling and at least one focused app test.
